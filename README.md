# How to use this project:

**REQUIREMENTS**

- Have a server where you are able to:
    - Make channels
    - Create Webhooks
    - Invite bots

<a name="netlify"></a>
## Easy Way: Deploy on Netlify

[![](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/jcsumlin/discord-ban-appeal)

- Click the "Deploy to Netlify" button.
    - You will be asked to link your GitHub account then enter values for all the environment variables.
    - Most of the environment variables will be provided by the Discord Application Dashboard
> **NOTE**: If you already have a custom bot in your server and access its credentials skip the next step
- Create a custom bot inside this server. You can register/invite one [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  
- Choose a channel (or create a new one) where you want all the ban appeals to appear.
  - Edit Channel -> Integrations -> Create Webhook
  - Name it whatever you'd like and make sure its "channel" is set to your designated ban appeal channel
  - Copy the Webhook URL and paste it in the `REACT_APP_WEBHOOK_URL` variable on Netlify
- Copy the required keys/secrets from your Discord bot application to the Netlify page.
- Deploy your application
- Lastly we'll want to  make sure users can login using Discord
  - First make any changes to the netlify.app deployment URL you wish, or set up your own custom one!
  - From the [Discord Developer Application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) Select the OAuth tab 
  - Click on Add Redirect and enter `https://[site-url]/callback` where `[site-url]` is the site name netlify assigned you, or the one you changed it to.

## Hard Way: Deploy on your own web server

This if by far not the prettiest way to do this which is why I recommend you use netlify, but if you're smart enough to deploy this on your own then go for it!

### Requirements:
 
Be aware this project uses serverless functions as its API layer. 
All the API requests are directed at /.netlify/functions because support issues with netlify's redirect rules. 
To deploy this yourself you will need to create a serverless API using AWS Lambda or an equivalent from Azure or GCP.
I will go into specifics below.

### Web frontend
- Fork this repo
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in each value
- Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies
- Run `yarn build` to compile a production build 
- Direct your webserver to serve the `./build/` directory

### Serverless backend

- Create a new serverless API in your cloud provider with 4 endpoints.
    - Each File in `/functions` will be an endpoint, and most of them will require both the files in the `/functions/helpers` folder
- Make sure all the packages from `package.json` are installed and available for each function
- Find and replace all occurrences of `/.netlify/functions/` with your endpoint for each function

I've oversimplified a lot of the serverless portion here since it will vary based on your cloud provider but this covers the jist of things.

## Differences between this repo and sylveon's
- Server icon and custom banner on landing page
- Only allow users who are actually banned to submit an appeal
  - Ability to disable this check
- Custom meta tags for better SEO and visibility.
- **IMO** a cleaner approach to custom questions.

<a name="featureplan"></a>
## Feature roadmap
- [x] Allow users to be blocked from submitting a ban appeal
- [x] Add better meta tag support
- [x] Custom Questions defined by the user
- [x] add hCaptcha/reCaptcha
- [ ] Integrate some means of alerting users who are unbanned
- [ ] Additional Actions such as "Deny Ban appeal".
- [ ] Optional Google Analytics tracking
